## Abstract
Project Valence is a 2D, top-down casual strategy game. Players are spawned in a chemistry laboratory where their goal is to complete a contract provided by various clients. With a new one provided each day, these contracts require the player to synthesize and deposit products generated in their laboratory. Failure to complete the day before the time runs out will cause the player to complete their run. After completing each day, the player will receive payment for the contract and move on to the next day. The products are created by combining the correct ingredients in the correct machines, otherwise garbage will be created. The recipes for these products are provided to the user to allow them to create the correct result. The physical structures of these labs are from a few predefined sets, but the machines and depots of ingredients are randomly generated to create a unique experience for every playthrough.

### Project background/Business Opportunity
Growing up our whole team was surrounded by a culture of gaming, we were raised in a community of people who loved to spend their time playing games together. As a team, we hope to give back to this amazing community and bring to fruition some of our own ideas into a casual strategy game that combines some of our favourite game mechanics and ideas that we have gathered throughout the years.

### Inspiration
One game that heavily inspired our idea for Project Valence is called 'Plate Up' where chefs in a kitchen frantically prepare recipes for customers, wash dishes, and bus tables. We wanted to take this idea and put it into the world of chemistry, the possibilities for products that can be made in a lab are nearly endless and the complexity of different pieces of lab equipment allows for an interesting and diverse experience with lots of opportunity for each playthrough to be different from your last. The idea of randomness embedded in the game is important, this is what makes each play through interesting, you don't know what product you're starting with and might have to learn on the fly how to use new pieces of equipment.
