## Project idea
Our project is designing a casual strategy game based on chemistry, where players will run a chemistry lab until they fail to complete various objectives. 
Project background/Business Opportunity,[edit]
Growing up our whole team was surrounded by a culture of gaming, we were raised in a community of people who loved to spend their time playing games together. As a team, we hope to give back to this amazing community and bring to fruition some of our own ideas into a casual strategy game that combines some of our favourite game mechanics and ideas that we have gathered throughout the years. One game that heavily inspired our idea for Project Valence is called 'Plate Up' where chefs in a kitchen frantically prepare recipes for customers, wash dishes, and bus tables. We wanted to take this idea and put it into the world of chemistry, the possibilities for products that can be made in a lab are nearly endless and the complexity of different pieces of lab equipment allows for an interesting and diverse experience with lots of opportunity for each playthrough to be different from your last. The idea of randomness embedded in the game is important, this is what makes each play through interesting, you don't know what product you're starting with and might have to learn on the fly how to use new pieces of equipment.
