# How does our game play?
When you first load in to your lab a screen will pop up showing you the first product you are able to make and directions on how to make it. From here, you will be given the choice of three contracts, one that is easy, one that is hard and one that is somewhere on the spectrum. Contracts are what give you points, they are your goal for that level and each levels difficulty is guided by the player. From here, you are able to see where your ingredient pickup zones are, machines, the garbage and the final product drop off. 

## How do you progress in the game?
Each day you are given new contracts to choose from, and after day one you have a chance to gain a new recipe. The more recipes you get, the more complicated the contracts become. Once you can no longer complete the contracts, you fail and start all over again with a new lab, new starting recipe and thus a new strategy.

## Character
Your character can only hold one item at a time, and each machine has a limited capacity, you will need your counter tops to house anything you want close but you will have to balance that with where each machine needed is in the process. 

## Machines
Machines hold from one item to many in a stack style inventory (first in, last out), a recipe book will be available so its always wise to ensure you are making the correct products!

## Future Features
In the future there will be a store between each round allowing you to purchase strategic new machines and upgrades for your lab to continue on further.
