# Noted feedback from previous versions

## Version 0.0.1

Questions from previous versions were asked, some notable feedback that came from 0.0.1 involved the tooltips not matching the control scheme used.

The two testers filling this feedback out also found the hovering item over the head as their preferred method of knowing what item they are holding, as well as finding the game easy.

## Version 0.0.2

Four the people who completed the 0.0.2 testing sections. The trash felt out of the way for these testers, and was often hard to use.

These testers also re-enforced previous conclusions that the recipe should be given 100% of the time.

# Feedback from Version 0.0.3

Two thirds of users completed between two and five items, the last third completed less than two items. 
This indicates that items should be unlocked more often, and the unlock curve will be shifted in 0.0.4.

A background was added in this version, and most users found it was not distracting to the main gameplay.

The end of day breakdown some users indicated that the system of company opinion was not clear, and they wanted more obvious notifications when actions happen.

Users indicated that the small maps had a good amount of time provided to them enough time to come up with a strategy. 
The time fell apart once users were placed solo into a larger map, and the time became too much with harder contracts and larger maps.
In the future, harder maps will have different item amounts to balance the game. This change was not reflected in version 0.0.4.

# What did users find fun?

"I liked the controls, and making recipes was fun once I learned the controls."
