    Works nice for keyboard
2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
    The level seems too big (note: was changed after this test)

    It would be cool to have all things spawn in the same place, specifically the depos.
4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
    did not notice they could be used.
5. Was the GUI useable?
    the thing above the head is hard to see
    brown clipboard seems out of place

    No commments

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
Yes
### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
Yes, 2 attempts with help
### Was there any game breaking bugs?
Grabage as a contract item leads to not being able to craft anything
### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
#### NOTE: This was before the final test version was complete
What am I doing? What is in the fridges? Aliasing looks rough, what do the depos contain before interacting?
Glass doors on the fridge to see the item inside would be nice. Zoom in the camera (note: already implemented post test).
A tutorial would also be nice.

    Why are they a thing?

    Why is my item shown in both the corner and above my head?
6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
    Thing above the head feels redundant
7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?

### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
#### NOTE: Copied from discord.
It is hard to tell that the mixer is a mixer.

He tried to put trash in a decor piece that was not trash.

Tutorial seems to be something that could be very valuable to show new players the basics.

Is there spoilage time on items or bad results of making things.

There is not much sense of urgency (music can help).

Clarify objectives and ensure the players can get through the easy stuff very quickly instead of creeping into more scope of items and recipes and machines.

3 fridges in a line was alot to deal with.

E felt good for grabbing, space for start, wasd for move all good.

Sound can help a lot since the audio feedback can show good or bad. So if garbage is made then it shows a negative feedback sound.

There was pressure but it was hard to notice, there should be something to notify them.

Fix garbage interaction sizing.

Overall: Get as many people as possible, get sound, get chemistry people to play it.

Question marks on how to make stuff instead of showing it on GUI.

A "lectern" to interact with to see recipes.

Hard to tell what is in the fridges (likely fixed with new depos).

Didn't notice the hand in bottom left. Said the floating item was okay.

Tried to interact with some of the decor to mess with it.

Add to user testing: what did you find fun?

### Targeted Questions

1. How did the control scheme feel?
    Controls felt clunky and might be better on a controller
2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
    Rectangle wasted a lot of time running around, OG map is perfect, "eyeball map" make the hallways a little wider to make it easier to navigate
3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
    Liked the randomness, "fake trash" was a bit painfull, colour did not help make them different, blue fridge is a good stark contrast
4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
    Once they started being used are nearly essential, the time now for what you are making its nearly essential
5. Was the GUI useable?
    The time looked at once or twice near the end, give a warning at about 4:30, clipboards are nice and fitting
6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
    above the head is nice, prefer on the head but both are usable
7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
    feels more mid game than early game, too hard for the first level
8. What did you find fun?
    the concept is fun, figuring everything out is fun, really enjoy that you don't know what everything is right away. Like the three contract choice.

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
Game mechanics felt intuitive, especially for this style

### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
6 attempts, completed 4 penicillin
### Was there any game breaking bugs?
Yes, on a new map the depo can be hard to get to because of the thin hallway that requires alignment within a couple px.
### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
Timer goes behind the head, kinda funky and don't like it.
No audio is strange
codex style recipe book, discover first then put it in, high mental load
clock flash red near midnight in stardew, that would help, tried with controller and felt instantly better
