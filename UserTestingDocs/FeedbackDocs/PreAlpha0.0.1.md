    Works nice for keyboard
2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
    The level seems too big (note: was changed after this test)
3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
    It would be cool to have all things spawn in the same place, specifically the depos.
4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
    did not notice they could be used.
5. Was the GUI useable?
    the thing above the head is hard to see
    brown clipboard seems out of place
6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
    No opinion
7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
    No commments

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
Yes
### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
Yes, 2 attempts with help
### Was there any game breaking bugs?
Grabage as a contract item leads to not being able to craft anything
### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
#### NOTE: This was before the final test version was complete
What am I doing? What is in the fridges? Aliasing looks rough, what do the depos contain before interacting?
Glass doors on the fridge to see the item inside would be nice. Zoom in the camera (note: already implemented post test).
A tutorial would also be nice.

### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
#### NOTE: Copied from discord.
It is hard to tell that the mixer is a mixer.

He tried to put trash in a decor piece that was not trash.

Tutorial seems to be something that could be very valuable to show new players the basics.

Is there spoilage time on items or bad results of making things.

There is not much sense of urgency (music can help).

Clarify objectives and ensure the players can get through the easy stuff very quickly instead of creeping into more scope of items and recipes and machines.

3 fridges in a line was alot to deal with.

E felt good for grabbing, space for start, wasd for move all good.

Sound can help a lot since the audio feedback can show good or bad. So if garbage is made then it shows a negative feedback sound.

There was pressure but it was hard to notice, there should be something to notify them.

Fix garbage interaction sizing.

Overall: Get as many people as possible, get sound, get chemistry people to play it.

Question marks on how to make stuff instead of showing it on GUI.

A "lectern" to interact with to see recipes.

Hard to tell what is in the fridges (likely fixed with new depos).

Didn't notice the hand in bottom left. Said the floating item was okay.

Tried to interact with some of the decor to mess with it.

Add to user testing: what did you find fun?

### Targeted Questions

1. How did the control scheme feel?
    Controls felt clunky and might be better on a controller
2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
    Rectangle wasted a lot of time running around, OG map is perfect, "eyeball map" make the hallways a little wider to make it easier to navigate
3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
    Liked the randomness, "fake trash" was a bit painfull, colour did not help make them different, blue fridge is a good stark contrast
4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
    Once they started being used are nearly essential, the time now for what you are making its nearly essential
5. Was the GUI useable?
    The time looked at once or twice near the end, give a warning at about 4:30, clipboards are nice and fitting
6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
    above the head is nice, prefer on the head but both are usable
7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
    feels more mid game than early game, too hard for the first level
8. What did you find fun?
    the concept is fun, figuring everything out is fun, really enjoy that you don't know what everything is right away. Like the three contract choice.

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
Game mechanics felt intuitive, especially for this style

### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
6 attempts, completed 4 penicillin
### Was there any game breaking bugs?
Yes, on a new map the depo can be hard to get to because of the thin hallway that requires alignment within a couple px.
### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
Timer goes behind the head, kinda funky and don't like it.
No audio is strange
codex style recipe book, discover first then put it in, high mental load
clock flash red near midnight in stardew, that would help, tried with controller and felt instantly better

### Targeted Questions

1. How did the control scheme feel?
    Played on keyboard and mouse, felt nice and normal
2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
    the original lab feels good, the largest lab "does not spark joy", 
3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
    aside from knowing where things are at a glance, its pretty good
4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
    very: used countertops to solve a lack of ability to see what fridge has what without walking up to it
5. Was the GUI useable?
    don't really notice it
6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
    both makes sense when there a lot more textures that may be hard to differentiate above the head
7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
    Feels like and actual rouge like
### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
yes, thought there was only one machine, and when was told there was two assumed they did the same thing
### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
7 attempts to complete the game using Citric Acid, did not attempt penicillin
### Was there any game breaking bugs?
Player did not expierence any
### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
Seperator doesn't look like a machine, game feels slow for level 1, enjoy that its a one handed game.
Put items on counter next to the fridge it came from in order to remember what was where.
Why is the player an "absolute unit"?

### Targeted Questions

1. How did the control scheme feel?
    Controls felt good overall. However, switching between E and SPACE is somewhat unnatural. It could be the angle of my keyboard, but it just felt awkward. Q perhaps?
2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
    Levels feel pretty good. I think the hitboxes of the chairs seem realistic but the trees are actually OP. I feel like I have to give an extra space between me and the trees in order to pass properly.
3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
    Felt good. However, I don't think you should let the trash can near any machines as I found in a few runs that the interact radius for the trash ate my product as I was in the final stage.
4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
    I felt the machines were too quick for me to make a whole lot of use for them. I could get maybe one item near a machine before having to go get product currently cooking.
5. Was the GUI useable?
    UI looks fine. I don't know if it's just me, but the contracts feel too far from the rest of the game? They are just so far out of the way in LaLa land that I can lose focus from the gameplay.
6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
    I think the item hovering above your head is superior. Keeps you locked in the entire time. My criticism for the item slot is the same as the contracts; it's too far from the action, it's almost distracting trying to use it.
7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
    The hardest part of the game is learning the recipes. I made the mistake of trying to do a multi-product contract on my first playthrough and bombed because I kept making garbage.
8. What did you find fun?
    Figuring out how to make a product was fun crossed with frusturating in a good way. Definitely a big fan of the time and space management aspect, although I didn't get to enjoy it as much I wanted.

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?

No

### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?

Yes, 5 attempts (2 raw, 2 to learn each recipe, 1 more to compelete)

### Was there any game breaking bugs?

Tree hit box too OP.

![treehitbox](./treehitbox.png)

There was a case in one of the more blocked off areas that you can't access fridges if they spawn there.

![remote](./remote.png)

Item name for fridges that spawn at the bottom of the screen are cut off.

![wordcutoff](./wordcutoff.png)

Not entirely game breaking, but the trash radius definitely feels bigger than others and likes to override prompts even if I am next to a completely different machine. I don't think it should be allowed to spawn anywhere near countertops or machines, fridges are fine.

![trashradius](./trashradius.png)

![impossiblelevel](./impossiblelevel.png)

### General feedback/suggestions from the tester: Trees are too OP like give me hedge trimmers or some way to get them out of my way.
If you want the counter tops to be used more, I think you need to slow down machine speed. As it stands, I feel like I only have time to grab (maybe) one item before having to hike it back and get the next stage of the recipe going. You may need to slow in-game time down to compensate for this, but it could be worthwhile. Could also increase player speed.

Contracts should be closer to the screen, there is chunk in the middle of my screen on most (if I recall correctly) levels that would be perfect. I then don't have to take my eyes off the game.

Depending on what your goals are for the game, it might be beneficial to add an "intro day" for each new recipe. This day would have no time limit and just the ingredients lying around (like how single recipe contracts are) so that the user can figure out how to make the item without worrying about a fail condition.

I am kind of torn on not knowing what is in each fridge until I walk up to it. While I like the idea of having to remember where everything is to add a layer of difficulty and optimization, it would also be nice to at least have a way to flash the items in the depos. Perhaps, at the start of the round before moving, the user can see what is inside of every fridge and once they move (or a short timer expires) everything is hidden just like the current version of the game; or some kind of ability that can be used to flash the items in each depot. Clear fridge doors would be a last resort IMO.

Not a big deal but being able to recover an item that is in a machine would be nice. A few times I accidentially doubled pressed E on a stage 1 or 2 product and put it back inside, resulting in garbage.

Would be nice:
A way to add more machines to your lab. This could be a purchasable or earnable upgrade.
I understand the RAMS update will add hazards, but I do think a way to investigate or research hazards should be implemented so the player can reduce any penalties that hazard may impose. Also, I think an Ice hazard that makes your characer slip (like in the pokemon games) is a must/classic.
When there are more recipes, adding a free-roam mode that can allow the player to use all ingredients to make any recipe with no time limit.

### Tester Gaming Experience Level
Most of my life so experienced.

### Targeted Questions

1. How did the control scheme feel?
	The control scheme was simple and easy to pick up, however
	collision with objects such as tables felt slightly off.

2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
	Levels were alright most of the time, tables could feel a bit random
	and perhaps a bit more colour wouldn't hurt.

3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
	they were distinct enough to stand out.

4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
	they are more useful for large orders or complicated ones
	can help cut down some time.

5. Was the GUI useable?
	For what was there it seems decent I didnt have issues with it.

6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
	I like the hovering item the most its nice that
	the item is right there for you to see.

7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
	I would say the game could be easy to medium difficulty depending on
        the person's ability to problem solve and memory

8. What did you find fun?
	I liked the problem solving aspect and the simplicity of combining items.

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
No I did not was not bad to figure out

### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
Yes I did after 3 attempts

### Was there any game breaking bugs?
Yes I had an issue with map gen and collision that did not let me access
one of the fridges. This was caused by access to the fridge being a 1x1
path. The path had a small divider wall just under it and with that and
a table by the fridge I could not actually use this 1x1 path. I believe
my character was getting stuck on the table.

### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
I think the game could be a fun one and obviously needs more to it.
It could be nice to have a system that records recipes once you figure
them out. I also think some more colour to the maps would be nice.

### Tester Name:
Shaun Myslichuk

### Tester Gaming Experience Level:
18 years, older (passed prime) gamer.

### Targeted Questions

1. How did the control scheme feel?
Natural, to a degree. Tooltips certainly aided in control scheme understanding. WASD is the natural method of
movement so that is obvious, as is using E to pick up and drop items. Space bar for starting machines is
different but a control that comes easily with experimentation. Feels odd having the mouse do nothing, however.
Not even a hover tooltip for what is in a machine / fridge.

2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
Level design was interesting, as in the mental game of route optimization was engaging enough. Sometimes the level
generation would fail to create a completable level, forcing restarts (See Bug Reports). Some levels were rather
constricting in their layouts, having almost too many items spawning in a specific area.

3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
Almost feels like a trash can should be paired per machine, as earlier experimentation proves to produce mostly
"garbage" items that require throwing away. One generation had the garbage can on one extreme end of the map and the
other machines on the complete opposite. Fridge and machine hit-boxes are somewhat smaller, causing one to get
caught while attempting to move after depositing an item.

4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
Counter-tops proved useful once tester realized that they could be used. Some generations had the countertops come
in handy more than other generations. A very map dependant tool.

5. Was the GUI useable?
The font could be clearer on certain resolutions, on fullscreen it is fine. The only buttons that work are "Play"
and "Quit" on the main menu, to be expected. The gear that most would associate with settings brings the player
back to the main menu which is unexpected. The inability to tell what is inside a machine while it is "mixing" items
hurts while less schooled players attempt to figure out the recipes via trial and error. The Mouse would be a nice
way to tell what is inside machines as it is otherwise useless.

6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
Hovering item works perfectly fine, works just like classic Harvest Moon. Found the item slot to be superfluous
honestly. If you could store more than one item at a time like in an inventory it would prove more usefull, otherwise
it is not required.

7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
The gameplay itself is dead simple, move items into other items in order to create new items to then process and sell.
The actual recipes are a bit more dificult, again, trial and error was mostly used to figure it out. Then again, I
am a bit of a dummy.

8. What did you find fun?
Prioritising the route, attempting to find the best and shortest paths to use for each step. Attempting to use "bake
time" to set up other recipes. Reminded me of the old Diner Dash games, as silly as it may sound. Get the right
things from A to B as quickly as possible.

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
Not a test supervisor per-se, but David did help explain a few things, such as the refining machine and the counters
being usable.

### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
Yes, too many including my own stupidity running down the clock and also poor level generations causing issues. Some
of the more difficult contracts proved to be, well, difficult within the time constraints. Somebody more intelligent
and / or familiar would have an easier time for sure.

### Was there any game breaking bugs?
Yes, See bug reports.

### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
A legit seperate sprite for the "Selling / Deposit Box" would be nice but it's functional.
Garbage Cans and Machines perhaps being closer together.
Making the character sprite collision box a little smaller to fit into 1x1 spaces.
"Restart Run" button would be cool but not required. "Restart run" option
Hoverable tooltips on things to know what is in what, specifically machines.
Ties into above but perhaps colour coded fridges? Doesn't have to match items just be unique at a glance.

1. How did the control scheme feel?
    The essentials were covered, It fit the style of the game as a 2-D Recipe Maker.
2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
    Could at times be chaotic leading to annoying pathing.
3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
    Again Can lead to annoying pathing.
4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
    Probably not as much as intended. never had enough time to use them. item in item out.
5. Was the GUI useable?
    The buttons that worked, worked.
6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
    The item slot was preferable. Sometimes the bubble would block my view.
7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
    Casual pickup game. easy for beginners so long as theres a recipe to follow.
8. What did you find fun?
    I can't necessarily say i enjoyed my time but i did pass the time with it. Kinda similar to cookout in that way, probably better with friends.

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
No
### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
Tester took 2 Attempts
### Was there any game breaking bugs?
No Bugs Encountered
### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
To take the game further you might want to consider adding more variations to the recipes. new machines and possibly a cooperative mode with larger quotas to fill.
If you can get some basic gameplay instructions down somewhere for first time players i think that'll really improve your score as frustration will go down significantly.

1. How did the control scheme feel?
    Feels good, it works
2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
    Sizes are good, add a little depth and challenge
3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
    Keeps it fresh and new, can't just memorize and create a map
4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
    They are very usefull
5. Was the GUI useable?
    a little confused when the day ends
6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
    Didn't notice the hand slot, above the head is all I noticed
7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
    Concept is not hard but its hard because there is a lack of understanding very straight forward, not knowing is part of the challenge
8. What did you find fun?
    Mind numbing, if someone handed it to me and said "play it" and have it on the go, maybe not to sit down and play for hours on end but a short term

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
Overall purpose of what is happening

### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
yes, 2 attempts to complete the first contract

### Was there any game breaking bugs?
Yes, already reported above

### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:

### Tester Name
Charles Osachoff

### Tester Gaming Experience Level
Relatively low, mainly plays flash games, but has played a few oldschool games like CIV.

### Targeted Questions

1. How did the control scheme feel?
The arrow keys felt better than WASD, and I am not a "controller guy".
But since I am used to flash games, I would prefer mouse-only. So clicking on a fridge will path my character towards it (similar to CIV), and then I could click grab/take or start instead of keyboard interaction (this may be useful if we want to provide similar functionality to a mobile implementation).
The [E] and [SPACE] took some getting used to, and I would sometimes be pressing the wrong one for functionality.

2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
Other than getting caught on things, the layout felt okay. But the one layout I got caught on the fridge and had to restart (see impossiblelevel3.png)

3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
They were not too bad, I thought the vending machine could give me multiple items, and some of the machines didn't stand out.
It would be nice to see what the fridges have in them before having to go up to them.

4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
Not yet, but once I figured out the timings and stuff, I think I would definitely pick up items and place them next to machines to optimize my movements.

5. Was the GUI useable?
I didn't look at any of the GUI on the edges of the screen, and I didn't know the item slot in the bottom-left corner existed until it was pointed out by test supervisor.
The clipboard was nice.
I would have liked the time to flash or show in some way that time is running out. There is nothing to prompt you or tell me that I have to finish the contract by 5pm. If the tutorial helped explained it, that could be an improvement. It should turn red when you get to the last hour (similar to Stardew Valley). I think an audio indication could be nice, but I usually play games with sound off.
I found some of the text hard to read when standing in front of a fridge, it may look better off to the side in the grey space.
I want a click or hover on the contract clipboard to show the recipe.
The font was a little clunky, and if fridges are at the bottom, I sometimes miss the "space to start", maybe even make the machine prompts lines closer vertically or have the "[E]" vertically in line with the A in "[SPACE]" which may make it appear nicer to read.
I wish the question mark popped up something on how to play and what to do. Especially the hover-over/click on the clipboard to see the recipe. Although the tutorial would have taught me those things.
It would be nice to know what the objects in the lab area when they are not obviously decor. Some machine-like items sucha s a desk with a screen or MRI machine saying what the item is, but no prompt, and the machines saying what they are, and having a prompt (i.e., "mixer" or "separator")
What is this? (trident-looking icon bottom-right for recipe tree). The buttons shouldn't be there if they have no interactions.
The font makes it feel like an older game, but it still feels clunky.

6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
I like that the player is holding on to it, but I don't know what specifically it is when I am holding it. If you are going to show what it is in the bottom-left item slot, the show the text for what it is, but I still prefer the item over my head.

7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
It was difficult in the beginning because I didn't have the recipe and what needed to go where. I likely would have made garbage if I didn't know penicillin was mold plus something else. It wasn't too hard once I knew what to do, but I just kept running out of time.

8. What did you find fun?
I found it interesting finding out what you needed to do, which is why I found running out of time on the first day frustrating. So an infinite mode / tutorial could teach you the core concepts, but some of the harder modes could allow seasoned players to play under more difficult circumstances.

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
I needed the control scheme to move provided to me.
I tried to interact with a few things that are non-interactable, and the test supervisor had to tell me that interactable things have a prompt popup.
I needed some prompting to find which machine may be the separator to make penicillin. I thought the separator was a computer.

### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
No, on my last of 4 attempts I only completed 3/4 of the penicillin in my contract. But I was able to optimize by performing some actions while machines were in progress, and likely would have completed the same contract on the next day.

### Was there any game breaking bugs?
I tried putting acetic acid in the separator with unprocessed penicillium already in there, and was kicked back to main menu (Cause unknown. Was running release so no debug output to view. May have been from pressing e or spacebar when attempting to interact with the machine? Bug not easily repoducable)
"Unprocessed Penicillium" item text did not fit within the popup box and the text was partially outside of the left and right sides of it.
I put two of the same item in the mixer and I wanted to remove one instead of making garbage (take item not functional)
I was unable to access a fridge in the bottom left-corner of one of the maps (Small3.tscn, tester recommended restart)

### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
I really want a recipe given to me, I tried clicking on the clipboard or hovering it to see what I need to do in order to make the final product, but I can't figure out how to make things without a recipe. A tutorial would be really nice in this case.
I was curious and wanted to pickup more than one thing at a time, (why?), because the player has two hands so he can hold two things. But it was fair that the character can only hold two things.
I was constantly getting stuck between the tables and the tree decor on the big level (Small2.tscn, see tablesandtrees.png).

![tables and trees](./tablesandtrees.png)

I tried to interact with the vending machine because it seems interactable.
I knew that I ran out of time when it reached 5pm, but I didn't know where to look in the second attempt of how much time is left.
It was very easy to get stuck on things that have a much bigger hitbox that appearance (chairs, trees, and some other miscellaneous objects).
It wasn't obvious until pointed out by supervisor that all fridges had a required component, and I thought some may be useless. That might be cool to have fridges that contain ingredients you don't need.
I like the different decor objects scattered about, I just wish they had some interactions or popups when you interact with them.
I wish the vending machine could give you a energy drink or consumable that would make you faster or some cool interaction.
I felt like I ran out time for day one, but if I was more comfortable with the game after a tutorial, I would have like a bit more time (maybe +50% more time).
I would really like a pause button from either the settings/help/recipes buttons in the bottom-left so I can stand-up and walk away and then come back and keep playing. Or clicking on the clock in the top-right could pause the game.
I think it could be enjoyable to play without a hard time-limit. Meaning there was no deadline at the end of the day, and instead after failing at the end of day 1, it would flip to day 2, then day 3, and so on until I complete the contract.
So upgrades or rewards would scale with how quick the user completes it.
If you want to annoy somebody, but a cat or something obnoxious in the game that gets in your way, such as a cat (see King's Quest game, where you will fall down the stairs if you don't kick the cat down the stairs).
The fridges being a different colour for each item might make them stand out more.
Once you succeed, a door opening in the lab to bring you to a new lab / upgrade section could be cooler than a popup of day passed.
I thought the mat was a pillar or something physical you could run into, until I walked over it, and I thought the "i" poster was an info.
I think it could be cool to customize your character of changing your hair/gender/skin tone/clothing.
The item name was also cutoff in some cases

### Tester Name
Yvette Osachoff

### Tester Gaming Experience Level
Very low (Did not know WASD was common for movement)

### Targeted Questions

1. How did the control scheme feel?
WASD felt very weird, arrow keys felt better, and controller felt best.

2. How did you like the overall shape of the level?
The overall shape and architecture of the level was okay... but I got stuck on a lot of things. Some areas were impossible to get to or very hard to get around (see impossiblelevel2.png).
I mainly got stuck on areas that were 1 floor tile wide to walk through and got caught on the counter or decor.

3. How did you like the layout of Depos, Fridges, and machines?
Every level being layed out differently felt good, and it seemed like a point of the game was to find where stuff was. I liked that I didn't know where everything was and I had to remember where everything was once I found out.

4. Did you find the counter tops usefull?
Once I knew what I was doing, I would have used the countertops a lot more, but I didn't know what to make or how to make them, so I never needed to put things on the counters.

5. Was the GUI useable?
I never looked at the time, it was tucked away and I need it to be more urgent (ran out of time on the first day without ever knowing there is a time limit).
It would have been nice to have some indication that it is 12:00 and you need to get moving. An audio indication for time would have been nice, and they didn't know that they failed because they ran out of time.
The GUI kind of blended in, to the point that there was no exaggeration of what time it is and if you should pay attention to it.
When prompted with the "hover and see recipe on the clipboard" option, I would prefer to see exactly what to make stuff instead of the option of "having it blacked-out and show once I create new things".
I don't look at my left, I look at my right to see things, so I would prefer to see content (GUI) on the right side of the screen instead of the left. (Would you have liked to pick that option?) Yes it would feel much nicer, I always go to the right.

6. Did you prefer the item slot, hovering item, neither, or both?
I liked that the item was hovering over my head, and I never looked at the bottom left item slot and didn't know it existed until told by tester. Once made aware of the item slot, I still prefer the hovering item since I am already looking at the character.

7. What was the percieved difficulty of the game?
For me, I had no clue what the whole idea / premise of the game, which made it very difficult early on. I didn't know that I had to mix A, B, and C to make D.
It felt so much easier to use the controller after using the keyboard first, because "I am more of a mouse person rather than keyboard" (user may have preferred mouse-only movement).
I would have played it again though. I need an explanation of what to do and what ingredients can make the final product.

8. What did you find fun?
I kinda liked the idea of grabbing and finding new things to mix stuff, but it needs polish, I don't know what I am doing to start.
I think if there was a tutorial I would like it more for someone who doesn't play very many games. But I like the little guy and the ability to move him around (character).
(Would you have liked a bit of text in the empty space for controls and your goals as a player?) Maybe. For the first level / tutorial, I need the controls and objectives of the game because that was a steep learning curve, but after the first few days I think I would have gotten it.

### Did the user need help to learn the game mechanics from the test supervisor?
I didn't know how to move, and I used WASD for the first time for movement, but found arrow keys better, and controller best.
I didn't find the majority of the game's concepts intuitive, I didn't know I should be making things without prompting and that I need to interact with fridges and machines.
I don't know why I failed when I ran out of time, and the test supervisor had to explain that to me.

### Did the user finish level one? How many attempts?
No, Even after 5 attempts with explanations of the goals of the game, the player was not able to complete any contracts, and at most completed 1/2 citric acid.

### Was there any game breaking bugs?
I got stuck on a number of counter tops and decor items since the clipping of the hitboxes was weird.
I kept accidentally putting items in a machine, and I want to take it out, but the "take item" interaction was broken, so I can't (resulted in a lot of frustration).

### General feedback/suggestions from the tester:
I really have no idea how to make the final product and what steps to do it. I need a visual prompting of some sort to tell me that.
If you could hover over the clipboard and see what steps to make each incremental item to create the final product, that would be very nice to reduce the learning curve.
If I go up to something and even if I can't interact with it, it would be cool to see text of what it is (i.e., if you are standing in front of a TV, it just says "TV" in the text box, but no interactions, Note: tester attempted to interact with many non-interactable decor pieces, such as the desk, MRI machine, or lockers)
I didn't know that I need to mix and then separate, why would I have to separate something instead of just mixing again? (what is the purpose of having multiple machines if both take 2 inputs and give 1 output and take the same time)
I need something to make the machines/fridges/depots to stand out over the other decor, and I need a tutorial or recipe guide to tell me what to do.
A bit of story could be nice, but it doesn't feel very necessary, although it could make it more interesting for a gamer to have some story behind the lab's actions.
