# Recipes Planned

## Penicillin

Mix the penicillium mould with nutrient powder to make unprocessed penicillium, the separate out the penicillium with acetic acid to purify it. 

Machines: Chemical Mixer, Chemical Separator

## Citric Acid

Mix Aspergillus and Sugar Solution together, then use Calcium Hydroxide as a catalyst in the separator before finally mixing with Sulfuric Acid 

Machines: Chemical Mixer, Chemical Separator

## Bio Diesel 

Mix Lye and Methanol, then mix in some hot oil before using water as a catalyst to separate out the Bio Diesel

Machines: Chemical Mixer, Chemical Separator

## Insecticide

Mix Calcium Hydroxide and Sulfuric Acid together, once complete mix in water to dilute it

Machines: Chemical Mixer

# Potential Future Recipes

1. Batter Acid, electrify Lead in Sulfuric acid, needs electrolysis machine 
2. Sour Vape Juice, Combine Citric acid with other vape juice ingredients, idea of tiered recipes that may be a future feature
